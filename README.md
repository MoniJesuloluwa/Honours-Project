# Gamification of Learning: Adaptive Tutoring System in an Educational Game

## Overview
This project explores the gamification of learning by implementing an **Adaptive Tutoring System** within an interactive **educational game**. The focus is on algebra as a starting point, with future plans for expansion to other subjects and topics. By integrating **OATutor**, an open-source adaptive tutoring system, the project aims to enhance learning outcomes for learners aged **10 to 15 years** through personalized and engaging gameplay.

The game combines educational principles with game mechanics to provide a unique learning experience that balances **educational depth** and **engagement**, drawing inspiration from successful commercial games.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Develop a **comprehensive algebra-focused educational platform**.
- Integrate adaptive tutoring systems for **personalized learning experiences**.
- Transform traditional algebraic concepts into **interactive gameplay** elements.
- Establish an **extensible architecture** for future expansion to other subjects and topics.

## Features
- **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling**: Questions dynamically adjust based on the learner's performance.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate feedback is provided to reinforce understanding and identify areas for improvement.
- **User Progression Tracking**: Tracks learning milestones and provides insights into performance trends.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Generates algebra problems and activities based on user progression.

## Technology Stack
- **Game Engine**: Unity Engine
- **Programming Languages**: C# (Unity Scripts), C++
- **Frameworks**: Unity's Scripting API, .NET Framework
- **Tools**:
- Unity's Event System
- Custom serialization systems for question data structures
- Real-time analytics for performance tracking
- Dynamic content generation algorithms for algebra problems

## Methodology
The project followed a structured development process:
1. **Planning and Design**: Defined the scope, user demographic, and educational objectives.
2. **Implementation**:
- Developed game mechanics integrating OATutor’s adaptive tutoring scripts.
- Implemented modular systems for dynamic problem generation and feedback mechanisms.
- Built a cross-platform compatible codebase for future scalability.
3. **Testing and Evaluation**:
- Conducted beta testing with friends and family in the target age group (10–15 years).
- Collected feedback to validate engagement levels and learning effectiveness.
4. **Final Presentation**:
- Documented the project in an **8,000-word academic report**.
- Presented the project at a **Degree Show** with a poster and live demonstration.

## Results
The project successfully delivered a focused algebra learning platform, achieving the following outcomes:
- **User Engagement**: Beta testing indicated increased engagement and improved learning outcomes among users.
- **Scalability**: Established a robust architecture for future subject expansion.
- **Feedback**: Demonstrated key systems' effectiveness while identifying opportunities for further optimization in adaptive algorithms and content generation.

## Future Work
- Expansion of the platform to cover additional topics and subjects beyond algebra.
- Optimization of the adaptive algorithms to enhance personalization.
- Incorporation of advanced gamification techniques to further improve user engagement.
